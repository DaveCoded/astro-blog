import Dropcap from '@components/MDX/dropcap.astro';

<Dropcap>Whoops!</Dropcap> I've borked it again. One of my commits contained my changes to the yarn.lock.
<MarginNote id={1}>
    ...that only work with *my* local environment because web development with billions of node
    modules is just wonderful
</MarginNote>

And I've pushed it and a PR's open and I'm _this_ close 🤏 to throwing my laptop out the window.

Now, I've been working on a branch named `dave/made-a-dumb-error-again`, which branched off `dev`. So, I can just run:

```shell
git checkout dev -- yarn.lock
```

And I'm saved thanks to [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38743912/remove-a-file-from-a-git-pull-request). Many thanks to [Jared Wilber](https://www.jwilber.me/) for saving my bacon.
